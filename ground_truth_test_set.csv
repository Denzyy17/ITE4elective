Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,My flight was canceled due to Covid & no refund,"My flight was canceled due to Covid, I originally purchased my ticket through a travel agency, however by re-booking my canceled flight through the airline I was able to request a refund from Philippine Airlines. However, when processing your refund request they request five months to process the refund. I later learned that this time frame is unacceptable. Refunds should typically be processed within a week, not 5 months. After calling over and over for more than a year, I still had not received any refund. Each time I called they would say that it has been forwarded to the refund department but that they could only request to expedite. This however resulted in nothing. I made refund requests both through the myPAL request hub, emails, and over the phone with a rep but I never received any refund despite multiple follow-ups. I even had to file a complaint with DoT in order for them to start processing my refund. After over a year, they emailed me saying a refund was sent and showed details of the processed refund. However, the details did not correspond with the payment method used to purchase the ticket. I emailed the airlines to notify them of the discrepancy and never received a response. I still did not get my refund through PAL this way. I ended up having to file a claim with my bank and was finally able to receive a refund that way, PAL never sent me the refund as they stated they would. I do however appreciate the politeness of the customer service representatives, though their services did not match as my requests were never fulfilled.",2,7-Aug-21,2,US,,Aug,2021,Negative

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,"No Refund, No Action","I've been promised by Flowerstore.PH that my refund will come within 48 hours, but it's been a full week now since I filed a request via PayPal and still NOTHING. I've contacted their Helpdesk several times but they just spew the same junk that they'll refund, but still no action. More and more, it is becoming clear to me that this Flowerstore.PH might be really shady. It spends a lot resources responding to customer review sites like this one (Trustpilot) but doesn't follow through on its financial commitments. It's too concerned about appearing legit in public forums but its business operandi is questionable. On its Facebook page, it just deletes posts that contains follow-ups from customers for refunds. Thank God it cannot do the same in this review site. However it does seem to use its numerous call center agents to just post positive reviews to drown out the negative reviews. I'll continue to post updates in this review site until my refund is issued.",1,19-Feb-21,2,PH,,Feb,2021,Negative

PawnHero & Marketplace,4.2,Great,Applying for a loan was a breeze. Redemption was a hell of a wait.,"Applying for a loan was a breeze. Item pickup was fast. But when it came time to redeem my item... It took more than 10 days to get it back. They never told me that when you redeem your item, it'll take more than 3-5 working days. Their process is, make your payment then send proof of payment to them. Which they'll respond with thank you for your payment. Your payment is for validation by Dragonpay. Once we receive confirmation, your item will be shipped in 3-5 working days. I paid June 4. I got my item back June  19. Should've been 18 but I was out. Still... That's way to long to get your item. In a regular pawnshop, once you settle your loan, you immediately get your item. With Pawnhero, not. They need to improve their redemption process.",2,20-Jun-19,1,PH,Invited,Jun,2019,Negative

Kung hnd pa ako nag reasearch na dapat trabaho nila hindi pa nila malalaman kung asan product ko. As part ng resolution nila dapat expidite nila delivery dahil sa inconvinience but ginawa nila stick to the date aug 20, pero sa app still aug 15. Sa side ko. They should made update.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,I would even rate PAL as -10,"I would even rate PAL as -10. This is the worst airline, and would NOT recommend it to anybody. Other airlines, like Cathay Pacific and Japan airlines, refunded me with in a week during the start of the Covid19 pandemic (March). I even have doubts buying from this airlines. I sent them multiple emails, I did get 2 different answers from different employees on, same date. One answer was the refund was being processed, Refund Certification was emailed to me and the other answer was ” it will take 5 months or 5 billing cycle to process my refund ( it's Nov already and I bought my ticket in March). I never heard anything positive about this company at all. You can talked to other Filipinos and they swear that they will never fly PAL ever again. Watch their facial expressions ( the hatred that they feel)when they talked about their experience with this company (mind you, I was born and raised In the Philippines). On their website, they stated that they refunded 80% of their customers. BBB are aware of this lousy company. I even wonder how long this company will last.",1,24-Dec-20,1,US,,Dec,2020,Negative
Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,"Ninja Liars, STAY FAR FAR AWAY","Today Ninja Van gave me a heart attack.  First I received an email saying my items were delivered.  No one showed up at my door.

It had said that I signed for the item, along with latitude, longitude coordinates of my address, it was definitely NOT my signature.  So guess what happened?  I found out the item was delivered to a collection point, I found that out own my own through no help provided by them.  That's right, I had to figure that out on my own.  But according to these crooks the item was delivered to me, at that address.  SO what the hell are Ninja Van doing?  Probably nothing.  I do not expect them to resolve this issue as they are incompetent.  The customer service responded saying it was delivered to my address.  Liars and crooks.  Fake delivery report.  Unbelievable.

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,"""fresh cut"" does not apply to what we got","Delivery was fast and on time. The recipient loved it. But when I was shown the pics, most of the petals have dead rotten spots. Your advertisement of the ""fresh cut before delivery"" seems to be false as the execution failed miserably. The recipient said the flowers looked as if they have been stored way before delivery. Only ONE has no rotten petals out of the DOZEN. The only reason this still has an average score is the process was smooth enough to warrant it.Also, it seems like only selected positive reviews are posted on their site as there is no option to make a review there, which is a typical move for any company or service.

And messaging them through Facebook is USELESS - they give the same canned responses with no idea what the problem was. It has been THREE WEEKS when the solution is just a new modem.

Due to COVID, the flight was canceled. My sister requested for refund since we used her credit card (and I just paid her back) last June 2020 and was told we have to wait for 6 months. But that never happened and after a series of back and forth emails from them telling lies that it was already in process, we were so frustrated because that cost us more 2,500 CAD each. I saw from one of the travel websites to file a case through Philippine Aeronautics Board. I told my sister about it and after she emailed the board, PAL expedited our refund and we were able to get it last May 2021. However, the tickets for our kids have NOT been refunded so she emailed them again copying the board and was told to wait for 120 days. Guess what?! It didn’t happened and they are saying the same lame excuse and then stop replying to her emails even the board didn’t respond anymore. I file also a complaint at BBB but their reply was that they will follow up with Manila Treasury Board so I rejected their resolution. We are planning to also file complaint through Canada Travel Agency (though it’s a long shot) as we are already desperate to get our hard earned money back. Why are they boasting in their website that 90% have been refunded when so many complaints here?! PAL, be fair to your customers and give back our money!!!

The, my service was abruptly cancelled and I was told that it was due to the fact that the monthly subscription tier was terminated. The i diots who kept telling me to upgrade never told me that I would be cancelled! So, after that, I was without wifi for almost two weeks before these morons came out and did the forced upgrade which discounted the use of a landline telephone. Cool, whatever. Never used it much anyways. Over the last several months, the wifi has gone out at least 5 times.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,Horrendous customer service & treatment of a person with a disability -- avoid!,"Philippine Airlines' horrendous customer service and attitude to a person with a disability (myself) was, frankly, appalling, and I strongly suggest you do not fly with them. Their customer service flat-out misled me *twice* prior to flying, and their incompetence cost me my mobility device which resulted in financial cost, physical pain, and a great deal of stress. Their customer service cannot be trusted, they do not respond, and they evidently just don't care.Here's what happened. I use a walking stick, and when travelling I take an electric kick scooter to use as a mobility device as I can't walk very far without serious consequences. I've travelled with my scooter (as a mobility device) for years as checked luggage, both domestically and internationally, always after obtaining prior airline approval. In January I was relocating to Japan, and we wanted to fly PAL on the one-way trip. I called and asked if it was possible to take my electric kick scooter as a mobility device. They said yes, just book the flight and call back so we can make a note on your booking. I booked the flight, called back, and they said no, you cannot fly with the scooter because it's not a mobility device. This was a shock, and I said I understand in general, but surely you have a dangerous goods department that handles these sorts of enquiries for passengers with a disability (as other airlines do). They eventually said if you get approval from your doctor (which I always do) & submit requested documentation, we will assess it. I provided everything that was asked, the airline's doctor signed off on it, and I was told, in writing, that I was approved to fly with the device. Great!That was until it came time to check in. At the terminal, as I'm preparing to leave my country permanently, they said you cannot fly with your mobility device, the PAL doctor's approval doesn't count, and they don't know why the customer service rep said I was approved to fly with it... even though I had it all in writing. No matter what I said -- or the fact I've flown domestically and internationally with the device many times for years -- they refused to budge.This was extremely distressing as I was forced to forfeit my (expensive!) mobility device and then suffer at my destination without it, as I only had my walking stick & no ability to get a new mobility device. I followed up the airline twice at numerous addresses, including the ironically named ""We care"" email address, and heard absolutely nothing back.This is shameful behaviour and I hate to think how they treat others with disabilities more severe than mine. Both customer service reps misled me before the flight, and the lack of any response afterwards just rubbed salt in the wound. I ask you to please consider flying with literally any other airline.",1,17-Feb-20,1,JP,,Feb,2020,Negative

Lazada,1.5,Bad,It is so sad that Lazada which everyone…,"It is so sad that Lazada which many thought was a great company is actually a terrible one in service both to buyers and sellers. Their system in not well in place, things done manually i can only guess as they always make mistakes with their accounting and all. So many glitches in their system. Worse of all the only way you can talk to them is through chat....which makes it so difficult to explain your accounting issues. As a seller you lose money because their couriers are not reliable. Products keep coming back even if the customer says they never left their home and no attempt to deliver actually happened. I think the couriers never even attempted to deliver in the first place. I know this for a fact because I am both a seller and a buyer. They told the seller who  I bought from that they attempted to deliver but no one was home. Not true at all because we helpers at home who have instructions to wait for delivery and ready to make payment.  Then the same thing is what they tell me as a seller, that my buyer  was not home. When i talked to the buyer, she said she never left home coz she works from home. You can only conclude that the couriers are not doing their job to the detriment of the sellers. It is so sad that management is not able to address this issue and so many others like technical glitches in their system. I wonder if Lazada will ever try to change anything.",1,Updated 21 Oct 2018,1,PH,Updated,Oct,2018,Negative
Lazada,1.5,Bad,I've ordered several times from Lazada,"I've ordered several times from Lazada, but the last couple of times we had problems with payment - one time, we paid with credit card and they didn't acknowledge the payment so the order was cancelled. Eventually they had to refund our money, but because our card is in another currency it cost us fees both debiting and crediting the account. So we got nothing and were out of pocket about P200.The other time I ordered a product and everything seemed find, but my wife wanted one too so I went back in and ordered again on the same day - apparently this is a 'warning' sign for them so they cancelled both my orders and AGAIN I needed to be refunded. However, everytime you speak to the LiveChat the guys have absolutely no idea what's going on, they give you crazy excuses which aren't true (""probably because we don't take foreign credit cards"", ""your card won't be charged"", etc...) and it takes a number of attempts to get it sorted out. Ultimately I end up with no product and down by about P200. I swore I'd never order from them again - but my wife saw some makeup she really wanted at a great price, so I decided to risk it just one more time. And I added a GoPro accessories kit to the order at the same time. What happened?? Again, no record of my payment, 5 LiveChats with completely incompetent operators, really slow, and we're still messing around. I decided to change it to COD so that the goods would be shipped before we were leaving home for travels, thinking that I'd be able to contact them and resolve the payment issue before the courier came with the goods. How foolish of me - it's impossible to get anything logical out of their support.

Lazada,1.5,Bad,Victim of Fraud / Crooked Delivery Man - ITEM NEVER ARRIVED,"I ordered a Michael Kors watch and paid for it via my bank card. Item was supposed to have been delivered 11 days ago according to their email but it never arrived. After multiple calls/emails this is still not resolved. They did however send me a screenshot showing the delivery receipt signed by someone. The thing is nobody came to my house and the name of the signature is nobody I know - the name is of nobody in my house or subdivision.  They cannot even blame a contract courier error as it was ""delivered"" by their own Lazada Express service. Previously with other Lazada orders, the courier will text you and say they will be delivering the item soon to make sure you are at home. However, this time there was no such text. This makes me think someone internally within their organization has stolen the item. As of yet my issue is unresolved and means I am out of pocket a substantial sum and no product to show for it. I have 5 active Customer Service tickets which are unresolved. They claim to return communication within 24-48 hours but they never do. I have also called their Customer Service hotline 4 times, spending over 700 PHP in load in the process. They keep fobbing me off saying they are looking into it. I have had no contact back from them apart from ""stock answer"" emails saying they will be in touch. Quite frankly they do not care about their customers. I would strongly advise caution when using this site, especially if you pay in advance.

I think they just need to adjust their stated delivery hour during this period since my order was late by an hour. Their delivery guy is then courteous and apologetic. I love that they have an option for bank transfer for those who do not want to use credit cards.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,My husband had his return flight…,My husband had his return flight cancelled to return to the USA on April 16th and we have been trying to get in touch with Opodo since last Friday May 8th to reschedule. We have been kept on hold for hours for the past five days every time we attempted to reschedule with Opodo. I finally got through to Opodo on yesterday May 13th after 45 minutes and I asked about alternative flights however got sent from pillar to post. I spoke about the same thing to several Opodo representatives. They kept saying they are working from home and don’t have access to all the database or that they are looking for dates but then put me through to someone else.  Eventually after another 45 minutes of being passed around to different people I was connected to a rep by the name of Samuel who seemed to understand and was trying to assist me and then I was disconnected. After which I received an email from Opodo stating that the request reservation had been cancelled and I needed to contact Phillipines Airport.  We have tried to contact Phillipine Airlines for 2 days at different times with no success.  I am so appalled at both Phillipines airlines and Opodo customer service. This has been going on for two weeks as we are trying to book a return flight back to the USA. Is there a way we can connect by Facebook chat for assistance?

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,Philippine Airlines Suck - Heathrow - Cebu,"Philippine Airlines: IMHO the world's worst national airlineNote to myself, use another airline to the Philippines, Phiiippine Airlines only have an advantage when travelling to ManilaBOOKING REF; KG5FKCPR721 / PR1869 14TH / 15TH FEB COMPLAINTPR72O / PR1842 23RD FEB COMPLAINT & DEMAND FOR COMPENSATION (IATA & MONTREAL CONVENTIONFlew London LHR to Cebu with Philippine Airlines - BIG mistake. Could not buy duty free at LHR because got some bizarre reason, you have to clear immigration and customs in Manila (which means getting your bags and then dropping them off again), then transfer to a designated domestic flight, which means 100ml security liquids limit or putting your 1 litres bottles of duty free booze into your hold luggage; yeh, right!Most uncomfortable long haul seat ever; BAD. Lunch trays do not fit the fold down tables; had to try to cut whole chicken breast with plastic knife while trying to prevent the tray from flying off the table. Horrible food too. Absolutely the worst long haul flight I have ever had. Then, they rescheduled the ""connecting"" Cebu flight which also turned up late; 5.5 hours in Manila Airport. Late meeting my girlfriend who flew in earlier from Legazpy.NEVER, EVER AGAINCompensation Philippine Airlines now please.Return flight even worse; Philippine Airlines cancelled my Cebu to Manila flight and stuck me on an earlier flight. This caused major problem as my girlfriend and I were on similar departure time flights (she on Cebu Pacific to Legazpy) so we could both have breakfast at the hotel (which I prepaid), allow me to check us both out (as the card holder and person that booked the hotel) and take the same taxi to the airport, so I could make sure all was well with her.Under IATA / Montreal Cancellation rules, I had the right to demand a suitable flight with another carrier, which Philippine Airlines refused to do. I would have to buy another ticket with someone else they said and then see if I could claim from them! Trouble is, the alternatives were all last minute expensive. Philippine Airlines even refused to upgrade my ticket as compensation. So, we had to change my girlfriend's Cebu Pacific flight to the day before, which last minute act cost me more than the original ticket price. Bottom line, I get to spend one less day and night with her, her holiday with me was cut short, I will have to go to bed really early and get up to leave the hotel at 3AM. I will then have a 5.5 hour wait at Manila Airport.I want compensation as per my legal right. I also want to complain about the conduct of their customer service managers at Cebu and Manila that refused my legal right to an alternative. They tried every excuse in the book not to help me including the coronavirus was affecting their scheduling (cancelled flight to China do not affect internal flights and those to the UK; you should kiss my feet for using your rancid airline while other Brits stay away from Asia, not treat me like some schmuck). If Philippine Airlines reply to this, I will update my review.Screw you Philippine Airlines; I hope you go bust.",1,"Updated Feb 21, 2020",1,PH,Updated,Feb,2020,Negative

Entrego,1.4,Bad,Package 0031-700001501009,"Package 0031-700001501009Sir’s, I do not know how to express my feeling towards your lamentable service, service being a misnomer, twice packages have been dispatched to my Baguio address from Lazada via your company with the same result both times, the parcel was undelivered and returned to sender.Not through any fault of ours, the address and contact information is correct we receive at least one parcel a week by other couriers with no problems and due to current Covid-19 restrictions I am always at home. No, it is because your system allows a package to be sent out for delivery, taken on a site-seeing tour of Baguio and flagged an attempted delivery, when the tracking information on your sites states “An attempt was made to deliver your package. Reason: No delivery attempt on route.” How in the name of reason is that a fault of ours or a failed attempt at delivery?  Then on the 24th June came the best one yet, as your delivery person called for directions which were provided, then disappeared for 45 minutes when only six minutes travel away, after the third time of calling he answered and by which time the heavens had opened and we were having a violent storm, I asked if he was lost and he asked if he could deliver the package on the following day due to the conditions to which I agreed. Only to find out when again the items did not arrive that the parcel was listed again as a failed delivery, the reason given “Customer changed date” I was flabbergasted!Whenever you return my package to sender it costs me no small amount of money, this is unfair and unreasonable when it is no fault of ours. I wish that there was a way of selecting the courier by whom my purchases were to be delivered on the Lazada website but unfortunately there is not, if it were the case your company would never feature in my selection I can only assure you that when I send items from here which is often, I will never use your diabolical company.",1,30-Jun-20,1,PH,,Jun,2020,Negative

Lazada,1.5,Bad,My review of Lazada is based on my…,"My review of Lazada is based on my experiences I have had in the last one year. I have ordered all kinds of things from mini tripod to dishwasher. I think one thing I hate the most about the seller's here is that they don't accept change of mind as a valid reason for return. If I have bought a product, especially after paying a fat amount of money, I think I should be able to decide whether I like the product and gonna keep using it. If not, I would rather return it than have a waste lying at my house. Now I understand I might be coming from amazing shopping experiences from websites like Amazon. Unfortunately such shopping experiences not available in Singapore and I have to make do with terrible conditions such as above. There have been times when the seller's have sent me wrong items, crappy items but I just didn't have enough time and energy to keep at returning things. Undoubtedly there have been few good experiences too with Redmart. They have let me process returns when they sent rotten stuff or wrong stuff. Overall my feelings are mixed about Lazada. I would say it's pretty convenient for groceries but not a great place to buy clothes (multiple cases of mismatched size, terrible quality of product), ok to buy some items of medium prices (hit or miss) and totally not ok to buy items were you pay a considerable amount of money because you have no control once you buy the item. You will be forced to keep it even if you don't wanna use it, coz once the money get in the pockets of seller's (almost all) they don't wanna let go of it.",1,11-Sep-19,1,SG,,Sep,2019,Negative

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,Ninjas fail again!,"My latest parcels arrived from oversea and cleared customs on 3 Dec.  The items were then picked up by ninjavan the following day and scheduled for delivery on 6 Dec.However, the delivery point failed and the parcels returned back to hub for supposed redelivery attempts.  However, the items were somehow ""not scanned"" upon return and these were not detected by the ninjas until I chatted on their telegram bot on 8 Dec to enquire when I received no further updates on the redelivery schedule after the 6 Dec fail.  The items suddenly became untraceable and an internal investigation was supposedly launched which would 1-3 days to complete.  I requested for a call back by the manager-in-charge to understand more  but alas, no one called.The following day - on 9 Dec, I called the customer service line this time instead of continuing with the bot engagements.  I was then advised the parcels had issue and asked to be given another 1-3 days to complete the internal investigation. I again asked for the call back and this time, a supervisor duly returned my call.  He confirmed there was an issue and was candid about the episode with apology.   Again, he asked for another 1-3 days to complete the investigation  by ""the relevant team"".On 10 Dec, I then wrote an email to their customer service zendesk ticketing system to report a possible loss within their warehouse transit network.  The reply came in to confirm there was indeed an issue and asked for another 1-3 days to complete the investigation.  They have been apologetic all the while, but no breakthrough in locating whereabouts of my parcels pending action by ""the relevant team"".It would appear the resolution time ""resets"" to default 1-3 days each time the customer makes fresh inquest into his/her case.I then demanded they declare the parcels lost within their tracking system so that a refund + compensation may be initiated to exit me from this trauma and bring about a suitable closure.  The email exchange then went silent, with update from the ninjas pending since my last enquiry via 3 platforms in all - telegram chatbot, telephone call, zendesk email.Today is the last day of pledged delivery window as indicated on Lazada platform and despite my final email check sent out earlier in the day, eerie silence prevails in Ninja quarters...pathetic performance and accountability!My parcels may now be confirmed lost, even though the ninjas are not admitting this utter failure, while keeping me wait in vain.While I shall next pursue  due recourse with Lazada, Ninjavan is highly not recommended for last-mile fulfilment due to gross unreliability and lack of delighting customer accountability just described.",1,"Updated Dec 13, 2021",1,SG,Updated,Dec,2021,Negative

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,Is there a zero star,"Is there a zero star? Repeated failures in delivery attempts probably the ""ninja"" is just eating burger somewhere during work then will just declare failed delivery due to various reasons then just go home. There's this 1 time that the reason for failure was according to them the parcel size was outside the permitted dimensions therefore not accepted at the drop off point. Ok that's acceptable to me so i updated the address to be my residential address instead. After that was 2 times failure in deliveries then the ninja called me up confirming the previous drop off point, like what?? you previously said it cannot be accepted at that collection point due to size constraints. So he asked me an alternative address which i, again, confirmed it to be the residential address instead due to this very issue and it was already supposedly settled 2 days ago. So he was like ok thanks for the confirmation of the new address. Little did i know that this means it will be another day of failed delivery and the reason was passed off as ""customer changed delivery address"", 😕 didn't i already confimed that 4 days ago?? It's also worth noting that i had another delivery of a different item carried out by DHL. It handled international shipping with no hiccups whatsoever, yet this ninja van only handled a local transaction yet it's now delayed by 5 days and still not settled.

PLDT,1.1,Bad,PLDT is notorious for being awful,"PLDT tends to be average for websites and video streaming, but in gaming I cannot recommend. The wifi may have it's good moments, but I believe that these good moments shouldn't even be counted as moments. I can accept a slow internet speed, but an inconsistently average to slow one is much more infuriating to deal with, and PLDT takes the cake for it. Here's the pattern that tends to happen, 1. The wifi is okay, it consistently functions like normal, and will slow down if too much work is applied to it.2. The wifi stops and gets cut out for some reason, and pldt would have to fix it.3. The wifi gets fixed, but it's not as it used to be, it feels damaged and unstable in connections. Sometimes only google, youtube and other generic must have sites are accessible, but not everything else. Sometimes you're connected, but there isn't any internet. The speed goes around the range of 1mbps to 200kbps, even just 10kbps.  More problems arise overtime.I am sure that its on PLDT, as when i use my celluar data on my area, it seems to be almost perfect for gaming. PLDT's speed is only half of what my data has given me, and its not even consistent. Most of the time I am alone in my home, so the speed cannot be blamed on my family's heavy internet usage if I'm the only one using it.Overall, PLDT fails to keep their promises of a ""fast and reliable"" internet connection. I can't even complete a phrase without lagging out in voice calls, truly infuriating.

It was such a massive waste of time. They have absolutely no regard for their customers, (even if you get the platinum service according to a friend), I mean unless you upgrade your plan or basically anything that would put money in their pockets. Then those are wonderfully convenient. I just hate how they downgrade you to having to post angry comments in their Facebook wall because they ignore you.

Lazada,1.5,Bad,Lazada simply cannot provide a returns label for an item that wasn't ordered.,"I am a regular shopper with Lazada Philippines, I gave up hope of receiving any competent conversation from their Customer Support long ago, and here are just some of my recent experiences that not just serve to demonstrate their incompetence but that they are also dangerous instructing their customers to transport hazardous materials regardless of what the consequences may be.One … I had ordered an 'American Legacy' brand of convection oven and I particularly wanted the American Legacy model, I specifically paid more for it, because I knew it to be one of the best models available. What the seller actually shipped to me was a 'Micromatic' branded model and when I complained they lied to me that both brands are exactly the same model and it, Micromatic, is the only model that they stocked, when I subsequently checked the then American Legacy brand listings they were all fraudulent, thay were actually for a Micromatic brand.So getting on to Lazada and going thru all the questions and answers, pictures etc. they asked that I return the item, I live on an island where we only have one branch of LBC and the tricycle fare to/from is PHP500 so we don't want to be wasting journeys to and from.I agreed to return it so asked Lazada for a 'Micromatic' returns label which they couldn't provide because I had never ordered a Micromatic, I had only ordered an American Legacy, I explained that LBC will not accept such a fraudulent discrepancy but rather than act to avoid such a situation they encouraged me to commit fraud by taking it to a different branch of LBC, we only have one branch!Lazada simply cannot provide a returns label for an item that wasn't ordered.",1,24-Dec-20,3,PH,,Dec,2020,Negative

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,I'll tell you my story from February…,"I'll tell you my story from February 21, 2020 when I arrived at Manila airport.Let's start by purchasing my Toronto - Manila ticket. I contacted your Toronto sales office in December for information on transporting a dog. I have been very well informed. I asked several questions about his departure and arrival given the size of his cage (30x42x56 inches), where to go at the airport in Toronto and where to pick him up in Manila also how it would be treated. I was told to go to the extra luggage counter that they are used to transporting animals and they are treated very well. For Toronto, everything went very well, it was taken care pretty well. For Manila, it was just the opposite.On the plane, I asked again where I should go to pick up my dog ​​who was in a very large cage. Nobody knew what to answer to me. I was told when I leave the plane agents will be there to assist me.I get out of the plane, ask where to go and I was told it will be next to carousel 4.I went to the carousel, no dog. I'm told to go to the quarantine office. No one was in the office, I waited. Someone arrived, I asked where is my dog, he told me that he did not know. I went back to the carousel, asked the question again, someone told me he will arrive by the carousel, I explained to him that it is impossible given the size of the cage. Do you really put cages with animals inside by the carousel ??? It is dangerous for the animal to be injured when the cage falls on the carousel. I hope not. He turned over and ignore me…. I'm starting to get a little nervous. I'm going to see other people who seemed to be more aware. I am told that they could not put him through the carousel because of the size…. by the carousel ???…. I must dreamed…..and he’s coming by outside and wait for him there. After 30 minutes, my patience reached its limit. I went back inside, couldn't find the people I talked to. I went to see another person, replied that they don't know how to get my dog ​​up. I kept asking questions because it was incomprehensible that we couldn't bring him up. No one answered me, they talked to each other and I didn't understand anything, I told them to talk to me but no. After several interminable minutes, I lose patience…. I am finally told that I can go down to see him.The shock I got out of the elevator to see all these people gathered around the cage, my dog ​​inside frightened and trembling with his whole body. I don’t even dare to think about the treatment they had giving him since leaving the plane so that he was in this state.Then there were endless discussions, the security who didn't want me to go by the elevator with my dog ​​and all those people around us. I had to get angry and ask to make them leave. I felt like I was in a circus…. After several more minutes, we waited for the chief of security to arrive. Still unnecessary discussions, to finally brought me up by the street.I’m telling you this briefly without all the details, it still lasted 3 hours.I asked if they were aware that I was arriving with my dog ​​in a large cage because I had already asked before I left and I was told that yes they communicated with each other and they are waiting for me. They told me they weren't aware I was coming with my dog. I think I did everything to make this trip to go well with my dog.

Then the Ninja Van driver took a photo of the wrong mailbox to 'prove' he delivered the parcel.  I sent a photo of my mailbox to Ninja Van by email, to prove that the driver put the parcel in the wrong mailbox.  My mailbox looks nothing at all like the mailbox where the Ninja Van driver claims he left the parcel.  I am guessing that the driver put the parcel in the wrong mailbox and then took the photo and then removed the parcel and kept my goods.  After not responding to repeated emails and phone calls, Ninja Van courier finally stated in an email sent to me on 25 November 2019: “We are sorry to inform that the parcel has been lost from our end. Our relevant team will liaise with Shopee to proceed for the next step. You may refer to them for the next step of either refund or to your seller for a replacement.”Ninja Van courier will no longer respond to my emails or phone calls, even though I proved the parcel was not delivered to me!

Lazada,1.5,Bad,Defective Product and Useless Lazada Customer Agent,"This is about order no. 240012238032983, a digital multimeter that can measure voltage, current, resistance, temperature. It was supposed to be an amazing deal for such a product. However, after several attempts of using the product, the first step of simply turning it on, was impossible. The product was defective. The next step was certainly to attempt for a return. Unfortunately, the market seller was located overseas. After sending them a message, an automatic message popped out indicating that for returns, one needs to communicate with the local customer service; that is, Lazada customer service.An agent/customer specialist known only as Rhea was assigned by Lazada for the online chat. But Rhea was clueless about returns for overseas marketplace seller, repetitively, telling me to communicate with the seller when it was already clear that the customer needs to communicate with Lazada. Rhea was so different from other agents I chatted before as she seemed to be a complete newbie. She cut me off from the chat and I could not request for a different agent. It is also unclear if the usual communication was recorded because as of the time of writing this review, my email is still blank. She needs additional training or needed to be replaced. In any case, the product is useless and Lazada is useless.

PawnHero & Marketplace,4.2,Great,Should have gone to a normal pawnshop instead,"I had my laptop picked up by their messenger last Thursday, April 21, 2016. I received an email from them that they have already received my laptop the following day. I waited the following week to get my loan. However, 3 days later (not counting Saturday and Sunday) I am still waiting for their email or text that my loan has already been remitted to my cash card. I decided to email them just to check if they are processing my loan. To my surprise, they emailed me that I need to send them a copy of my ID and cash card. The reason behind that is the messenger took crappy pictures of my ID and cash card. No one contacted me to tell me that hey we have a slight hiccup processing your loan. I would appreciate that I get updates if something like that comes up. I was blindsided because I was thinking that there was no problem with the appraisal of my laptop and I would get the money within 24 to 48 hours. I pawned my laptop because I needed the money badly. But because of what happened I ended up having to borrow money from my friends which was embarrassing. I needed the money yesterday April 26, 2016. What if this was a life and death situation? Someone could have died because they did not have the money to cover their hospital bills. I am really disappointed with the way you handled my account. I will never recommend you to any of my family members and friends needing quick cash to pay or cover for something. You are claiming that we can get the loans proceeds quickly and it would only take 24 hours for you to remit the loan. But in reality I have been waiting since Monday for you to remit the money. I have no choice but to just wait for you guys to finish appraising my laptop. I knew that this business model isn't ideal but I decided to give it a try and I was very disappointed with the end result.

And one time he picked up my boxes around October time last year he was asking for $$$ for ""pamasko"". I don't mind giving tip,  ONLY with good service. I should have reported him on that incident but I didn't because I thought it might cost him his job. I just told him that I don't carry cash.Also they give you a time frame of 4 hours of pick up. So you wait for them and can't go anywhere and they are still late with that 4 hour period so technically you wait for them for 4+ hours.The customer service also is bad.

But on that same day I received a package from a different courier from the same order number  They were able to contact me and I was at home the whole day. I called the courier and they told us that our item is for redeliver so we waited. It has been 4 days since we received the notice. We call them everyday, morning and afternoon to follow up on the status of the item but still no use.I called the seller to inform them that our item was not delivered but instead of helping us they told me that the item is on its way back to their warehouse. I asked them if I can pick it up instead but they told me to just make another order. My order is a total of 50k and my order from them is 11k. they want me to just make another order while I wait 45days for the refund. They even said that we cannot pick up our item  even though we told them that the courier agreed that we can pick up the item at their hub with the seller’s consent.I also called lazada and I just wasted my  time and money talking to useless CSR telling me to just email them my complaint while I’m already talking to her.

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE,"As someone who's worked for customer service for more than 10 years and now a business owner, it is quite alarming how Ninjavam doesn't know how to take ownership of issues that are obviously caused by pain points in the process, the value of a future-proof resolution and efficiency.This may sound like a simple issue but it has dragged on for so long which made it much more frustrating. I have made an order through Shopee where I never had issues with my address being tagged as a ""double entry"" as stated by one of their representatives. I have then encountered that issue and was told to just reorder which doesn't really resolve  it because it would again be tagged as a ""double entry"" which the representative refused to understand.  It is like talking to deaf ears.The thing about Shopee's dropdown options for the district is it doesn't include my district so I had no choice but to pick the nearest district which is ""Santa Ana"" and just put ""Sta Mesa"" on the address field so that the driver doesn't get lost. Ninjavan immediately tagged this as a ""double entry"" which makes sense at first but if you do a bit of checking as what other couriers are probably doing because this issue is ISOLATED and applies only to Ninja Van, there is only one ""Illumina Residences"" in Metro Manila so this double entry is not even relevant.Because there was no resolution provided by Ninjavan, all my orders with Ninjavan as the courier has been tagged as returned to sender. I have contact their customer customer service line and spoke to a rep who kept me on hold for a whole hour because he needed to check with a supervisor and when I finally asked to speak with a supervisor, he then place me on hold for a whole hour without going back to check on me from to time to time. He promised a callback from a supervisor which never happened. I wrote an email to their customer service manager and chief operating officer about my experience and was ignored because obviously I do not have any value to them and I am a waste of their time. Why have customer service department if the department doesn’t do the job? The more complaints they get, the bigger chances of Shopee cutting them off.",1,10-Jun-20,3,PH,,Jun,2020,Negative

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,Management is lacking...,"I really wanted it to be a good grade but the flowers were almost 4 hours late and it was her birthday.

If that was the case, why didn't anyone book another rider to deliver it in the 4-hour span it was just on the store.The flowers were beautiful but as it arrived at almost nighttime, the sunflowers were soft and almost wilted. The rider apologized as she was only one of the few company riders and I understand it wasn't her fault. She said that she had to come back from a delivery to the store then get my package to deliver to me.Anyway, flower quality fine but management and customer support (who has been telling me that the rider is on the way for the whole of that 4 hours in which I have email proof) are severely lacking. If a problem rises, please tell your customer instead of making hollow promises and lying. I'll still order again in the future but if it doesn't work out then so be it.

On the third month is where the stupid wifi acted up, we relocated the wifi to the closest window that was also near a Smart Signal tower it gave us good speeds of 13 Mbps and can handle two devices but then, the next day it only gave me 0.9-1 Mbps its like they smelled that I was getting good internet and started tampering with the speeds this is still happening to this day. They're like teasing you to get a good internet and then takes it away after a day which is annoying considering how many people are trusting them. We are also NOT FOND with their FamLoad offers, All of them have that stupid 1GB per day for YouTube why cant you just make it into a flat 19GB open access instead of putting 12GB as open access and then giving the rest during the subscription length and the Gigabytes dont even stack it expires at 12 am. We want to get the fixed fibr internet but we cant because ""there are no slots in ur area"". Why even bother accommodating  more customers and making them wait 2 months before you tell them that there are no slots available. Better fix ur $#1t now because The President is on ur tail let me remind you.",1,Updated 1 Sep 2020,1,PH,Updated,Sep,2020,Negative

I've experienced many issues not only with internet, but also with the phone service. I had to visit the local globe office and wait for an hour as the local office cannot perform any function other than collecting money. Any other issues they have to call Manila and wait on hold. I did this for two days as the problem was not fixed correctly on my first visit. I waited One hour 20 minutes on my first visit, and 53 minutes on my second visit as they waited on hold to speak with an representative in Manila. I asked them to adjust my bill and said why should I pay full price when I have temporary service? Again it was out of the hands of the local store, only main store can take care of most all issues.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,Worst flight experience I've ever had,"Worst flight experience I've ever had. Hong Kong to The Philippines:Arrive 2hrs early and the flight is cancelled (Hong Kong to Lon Via Philippines) and the staff had no information for the first 30 minutes. Fortunately there were 2 other people flying the same route and a solid dozen flying the first leg. We finally get rebooked onto a different airline, based in a different terminal. Here begins the journey. After a rush across Hong Kong airport we arrive and the new airline needs to update their system firmware to on-board us. This takes a serious amount of time and how it was handled did not instill confidence but we eventually are on the plane, setting off slightly late. The actual flight (NOT Philippines airlines) was rather nice, a short haul with everything it needed. Philippines to London:We land at the wrong terminal and have to clear immigration & customers to then rush 30 mins across the airport to then go through passport control before we can board our original flight to London on Philippines airlines. The PA flight to London was rather long as expected but did not include any food or drinks, instead opting for high payment prices & shortages of drinks (alco and non-alcho) and food. The flight didn't include any blankets or pillows from what I can remember (I'm sure you could rent them for a cost). This was a stressful experience from start to end, at not much cheaper than other options, certainly not cheap enough to account for the terrible quality. The worst part of this is that they couldn't tell us why the flight was cancelled and did not warn any of us in advance, despite having all of our contact details. They instead opted to wait until we tried to check in to highlight the problem. We were once told that the flight was cancelled because of an issue the DAY BEFORE but then told us this was incorrect, which felt more as if they realised us knowing they'd known for over 12 hours and done nothing looked bad on them. I would argue that there wasn't enough of us passengers to financially justify anything but putting us all on the half empty competitors flight. NB. It's worth noting the actual staff were actually really friendly and professional despite the chaos but it felt more as if their ability to help resolve the issues was more experience with things going wrong regularly.",1,28-Oct-17,1,GB,,Oct,2017,Negative

I contacted CS via chat and the rep said he would follow up my withdrawal request. Days has passed again and nothing happened.

She requested another 7-10 business days and promised to give me updates but she was lying. I didn't receive any update from her. This is very unprofessional. I then received a call back from a gentlemen and he assured me I would receive my money within this week. He was very confident and told me that my withdrawal will be released within that week.

I thought they could be trusted. 3 weeks on and 4 calls and follow ups my boxes were never collected. I even wrote a email complaint to the main company LBC but never even received an acknowledgement to my email or a reply. AVOID!!! I have been warned by some Filipinos but I didn't listen because when I rang them, the staff seemed helpful and clear with the service offering they provide. Now I realise, they have one call centre in the Philippines and they just relay the messages to the UK. I have not been able to speak to anyone in the UK. Nor has anyone contacted me.

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,Ninja van Ninjavan consistently failed,"Hi, dear all,I am trying to stay objective and factual by seeking any similar incidents.For the past 2 years, I have been a heavy and regular user (client, patron and fan) of Superbuy and IE-Post.Sellers in China via Taobao, Tmall, Xianyu (Idle Fish), Weidian, etc -> Superbuy -> Shipper (IE-post) using (Shipping methods: IE and IE-MG) -> When parcels reach local shores -> IE-Post hand over packages local courier, example recently Ninja VanIn recent months, I personally experienced that ever since IE Post switched to Ninja Van,I have experienced more than once failures in terms of:- safety of my parcels (parcels have been damaged resulting in damages to the contents). I have ascertained it is not Superbuy's or IE-Post's fault from reviewing the videos of packing, value-add services, packer ID tags, internal controls, etc- reliability (consistently, parcels are delayed with parcels submitted earlier being delayed while parcels submitted later have arrived)- scheduling (I discovered Ninja Van's business model and sales pitch to forwarders like IE Post are based on their much touted computer algorithim optimised to cut costs and minimise time for Ninja Van, while allowing and condoning compromised schedulking; and customer service)- customer service (or lack of). Emails to Ninja Van are glossed over by Ninja van's customer support; who either throw the problem back to the customer (asking you to go contact the forwarder yourself to solve yuourself) or pass the buck (putting the blame on IE Post or even Superbuy). Worst, deflecting, dismissing and ignoring your emails entirely. Their customer service is a joke- a lip service and exist for the sake of having a so-called customer service!I attached screencaptures of the recent (repeatedly so) damaged parcel (and dismal customer service: at best, unprofessional; at worst, unprofessional and unbecoming in the capacity as customer service representing the company Ninja Van).Hi, I agree... Repeatedly consistently I faced difficulties with the homegrown ninja van in failing to meet in terms of quality/reliability/safe handling for deliveries, flexibility in scheduling and any form of assurance in terms of customer service/support! Ninjavan has damaged my parcels more than once, causing damages to the contents. For example, please see screencaptures below. For damage, despite m supplying all the photos and details, they kept emailing to ask for more explanation! Then comes the claim. They admitted liability yet they push it to the forwarder and purchasing agent! Despite admitting the liability, i received conflicting messages and discovered they actually wanted the forwarder and purchasing agent to pay. AND this happened more than once! WORSE, the customer service is dismal. For example, in my latest recent parcel which is damaged, customer service simply deflected the problem, threw the problem back to the customer and even passed the buck to the customer to go solve himself. And she is so inconsistent and contradictory in her replies. And in my last email to her to clarify, she simply refused to reply though my receipts showed she read it, instead she rudely forward me an email of the forwarder without any explanation! This is NOT the first time. WORST, if you email or submit enquiry tickets, they will never be elevated upwards. The customer service will intercept at their level- to the extent of simply ignoring you! And my attempts to contact the senior management, (despite all the talk on their website about feedback) example CEO or COO (or even the company Facebook) fell on deaf ears!!! Email receipts showed they received, and read- yet not even a short note from them!!! Then I found out their business model is to offer cost-cutting and time-saving to their partners (WITHOUT considering us, the end users who are the final recipients) from their much touted (and I experienced) so-called computer algorithm in ""optimising"" routing and timing! And of course, their customer service is actually more like a dis-service or mere lip service- the end user comes to them with a problem, but the customer service will throw the problem back to the customer and ask the customer to go contact the forwarder or their business partners). And this is NOT the first or second time! Are we stuck with Ninja Van if we choose to use IE-Post?For screencaptures as evidences, please refer to my sharing on reddit.

PLDT,1.1,Bad,PLDT FRAUD COMPANY - SHUTDOWN PLDT,"PLDT is a scam company that pretends to provide internet and landline services. Its nothing but a national disgrace. How this company can be allowed to operate like it does is nothing but a scandal and says more about the government than anything else. How can you take more a month to install or reconnect services for internet and landline and get away with it? By locking people into unfair and unjust or 3 year contracts thats how. Then you can do whatever you want, lie to customers, tell them it will take 3 to 5 days, which it should, but that never happens. It takes maybe 4 to 6 weeks if you are lucky for the internet to be installed or relocated to a new address. 3 weeks maybe if youre lucky for just the service order to be created. Something that anyone with half a brain could do in one day, takes this company 3 weeks to do. Then after 1 month you still dont have any notification when it will be done. How long has this company been in business? Let me tell you 1928. So thats almost 100 years of being in business and thats about how long you have to wait for anything to get done there at PLDT. So many years in business yet they still have no clue what theyre doing. All they do well is Apologize and tell you lies. They made over 3 billion US dollars in revenue in 2019 yet they dont hire staff with any brains and they dont train their staff either. Instead of hring enough staff or hiring enough technicians, they dont dothat, because they would rather be greedy and take peoples money instead of providing a proper service. How can they get away with it? Because the government dont do anything about it. PLDT probably pay them off. ITs just an absolute disgrace and its issues like this Philippines will never progress forward as a country because of the incompetence of these kinds of companies. People work from home and students study from home and instead of something being done about companies like PLDT lying and being incompetent, nothing is done. FIlipinos should unite and protest about this kind of greed and incompetence, then maybe just maybe things will start to improve. PLDT is a national disgrace. Limit peoples choice then allow these companies to create monopolies and charge people what they want then provide almost useless service because they dont do anything or takes them forever to do things that should take a few days.",1,18-Nov-20,1,PH,,Nov,2020,Negative

Unaccountable, as the NTC (the local regulator) has little or no interest in forcing the company to comply with it obligations to provide usable services. Unaccountable, because the Philippines civil court system is broken and suing Globe does not provide relief.Unaccountable, because there is no will to force this parasite of a company to change its thieving ways Globe are nothing more than a government endorsed criminal enterprise.

However, in the long run, the situation was significantly improved by the excellent attention given  to my wife (for whom I was buying the ticket) and myself. Joanna phoned 3 times and sent several emails within the space of 45 minutes to keep us updated and complete our payment. The emails included my wife's e-ticket which Joanna took time to ensure was correct.

Philippine Airlines won't answer her calls or tell me anything. We don't know what to do next other go to the airport and hope for the best. Philippine Airlines are without shame. It is profoundly irresponsible what they are doing leaving my wife and children in a foreign country with no instructions as to what she is to do next to make Philippine Airlines honor their transaction.Philippine Airlines is by far the worse airline I have ever seen. Especially internationally. They are predators.So my wife and children are still at the airport trying to get Boarding Passes for the flight we booked. Since her American Visa requires that her Port of Entry be Dallas Fort Worth.Cheap-O-Air talked with Philippine Airlines Manila and American Airlines. They said that the PA counter in Shanghai has to produce a Flight Interruption Manifest which my wife and present to the AA counter to get booked on her continuation flight. PA Customer Service refuses to produce the documentsGetting the police involved now.This is not a matter of incompetence, this is criminal. PA is just trying to avoid the cost of having to book a flight for a passenger whose flight was missed because a PA flight was delayed.Philippine Airlines has stranded my wife and children in Shanghai.

Graying out the vouchers when you go to checkout at the exact moment they become available, or worse, running out THE EXACT SECOND they ""become available""--is it even humanly possible to claim these vouchers within 0.1 seconds? This platform is shady as hell. And the honest sellers get caught up in it, because Shopee can't be bothered to do quality and background checks on sellers and products. They let the scammers get away with selling counterfeit products and put it all on you for making the purchase, even when there isn't always a way to check their authenticity. It's ridiculous, because if they were doing their job we shouldn't have to worry about these things. Their customer support is beyond useless, and often come off as half-wits who don't even know how to form coherent sentences because they themselves don't know what the hell they're talking about. They will give you the runaround and they won't even bother trying to hide it. They are incompetent, and most likely don't even get paid minimum wage and just signed up for the job because some recruiter pulled them from the streets. Absolutely abhorrent.

The first thing Lazada needs to do is empower those CSR's to actually fix, followup the problem..... and stop giving excuses for bad business practices! Try 1st time/1st call resolution!2nd, actually vet the sellers, and make sure that what they advertise is what they sell!

The customer service did not ask for any landmark so they can find our area. Instead, they told me to contact the shipper instead for shipping dispositions. In my opinion, this is a very poor customer service. I tried to call one of their branch and when I was still talking and telling them about the tracking number they told me to be quick because they are closing and then hang up on me. To me this is very unprofessional. I am now the one looking for my parcel instead of the company looking for people’s location, who paid them to deliver, expecting their parcels to be delivered on-time and at the exact location.

So I called them to get the other flights sorted out and they cancelled another leg but they couldn't cancel the part that was operated by QATAR airways.They told us that we have to contact eDreams coz the ticket is booked through them and the eDreams was not reachable so the trip for section that was not cancelled was flagged as NO SHOW by PAL.When we asked for refund they insisted that we have to approach eDream and still after 7 month we have not received refund for the section that they marked as NO SHOW. This is obviously their responsibility to coordinate cancellation of all trips when they cancel two legs.Follow up phone calls were all a waste of time as they repeated that we have to approach travel agency.If they wouldn't have flagged part of trip as NO SHOW we could have got full refund when eDreams initiated refund process.No a good customer experience as first time user of the PAL services.Reservation Ref N7XO7U just in case their customer support care about doing the right thing and trying to refund our money.,1,1-Nov-20,6,AU,,Nov,2020,Negative

So I played bad games in roblox. Then my mom allowed me to play Roblox on her MacBook so I did. It was a bit laggy tho. Then 1 year later my mom allowed me to play fortnite. Yes I did play Fortnite on a pc one day and no lag. But thats because I was in a restaurant filled with gaming computers. But Fortnite mobile in my house? Disgusting! Frame rates are very high and lags a lot. So much lag that in Nov 2019, I smashed my iPad. So then my parents bought another iPad. I hit it one time (probably because of lag or I got sniped). Then I never hit it again. Then I played Jurassic world the game all over again. Serious lag and always disconnects at some point while I play. Then I saw Jurassic World Alive. I stopped playing JWTG and played JWA. It didnt lag too much but by the day I was writing this, it was very laggy. My Fortnite was very laggy too while I was practicing with my edits.

I deliberately ordered it from a shop that was about 8 km from my house so they could get it here ( if lucky) the same day. The used NinjaVan.... 5 days later it is still sitting in their warehouse because of the following reasons.*i wasn't in ( I'm on Home quarantine i have been ''in'' for 264 hours so far. They said they tried to deliver at 10pm at night and had a photo! the photo was of daytime. They said it would be delivered the next day urgently, it wasn't. They Close on SundayThey said it would be priority one on Monday... if it was it means nothing was done at all for any customer.... it did not leave the warehouse.  Then they said their were too busy to deliver it. Customer service are nice enough but when you call they have zero power to make anything happen. (41 emails, 5 phone calls and a manger telling the warehouse to deliver it made no difference) They are not fit for purpose.In my opinion they got annoyed at me asking where is my parcel and decided to keep it to hurt me. It worked, i was on Home quarantine without the means to work and it has lost me a lot of money. They did promise yesterday, which i knew would be a mistake, it would have been 3 days then. Which would have fitted their 'rules' however seeing as it was 8km away they took longer than if i had tapped the laptop to a turtle and pointed it in the correct direction.

I was assuming that I am one of the very few customers who is facing issue with their delivery service but after reading all the reviews here I can confidently say Ninja Van has no ethics what so ever.

I have been following up with the customer service every day for the last 8 days and I still don't know what the status of my order is. The item is in their sorting facility in Singapore, which is 40 mins away from my place and you still have no clue how to deliver in these 8 days. What sort of warehouse management system are you guys even using that you can't figure out a simple outbound operation. Forget about delivering within 24 hrs that's out of your league. 8 days ????? Are you kidding me. Do you guys happen to have just 1 delivery van doing the deliveries by any chance and that's why you are screwing everybody's orders ??

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,4 FAILED PICK UP ATTEMPTS,"4 FAILED PICK UP ATTEMPTSTerrible pick up service and customer service. Highly disappointed and giving customer empty promises.1. Arranged a pick up for 7th Sep between 12 - 3pm and waited the whole day but to no driver picked up the package nor does anyone inform me about the failed pick up.2. Called in to rearrange the pick up and was agreed on a new date and time from 10th Sep between 3-6pm and again, no driver picked up the parcel. This time, at 5:41pm customer service called and the reason is not enough space in their van so suggested to rearranged the pick up (again).3. I agreed to rearranged to next day (11 Sep between 12-3pm) and reminded the customer service representative that this is already the 3rd time and shall be the last time I expected for the re-arrangement of the pick up. HOWEVER, again, no driver picked up and I decided to see and wait until when will they have the courtesy to call or pick up my package. So, a customer support representative called at 6:58pm informing me that, yet again, 'not enough space in our van so we want you to reschedule the pick up service'. So I asked her to justify the reason why a single pick up service can failed for 3 times in a row and she (initial A), insisted that the reason is ""as is and her system already say so"", 1st failed attempt - ""no reason why the 1st driver never arrive but he just never arrive"" and 2nd, ""this is only the 2nd time that the rearrangement was made"" - when I asked her ""if she is sure that this is  the '2nd' time"" - she insisted ""yes very sure because her system reflect that"", even though I told her that this is the 3rd time and I even received 3 telegram messages as well as the call history. The last customer service who attended sounded so pissed off at me when I asked her if she is sure about the number of attempt and she even raised her voice. So, requested for a call back from the manager.Current status - Manager called and gave the same explanation that they have failed attempts and reason is always no space in the van. Apparently, according to his system, the original schedule that I had was 'routed' and means that no driver is available on the day so no one pick up the package and hence, no notification will be sent and it was not even counted as an attempt. He mentioned that the responsibility is only on the freight department as they are responsible for the driver and the arrangement. Who care which department is handling it, you are from the same company, any internal issues you have, you handle it internally and do not cause those issues to affect your customers and making your company look super unprofessional.Latest Update: 13 Sep - 4th Rearrangement (6-10pm) - STILL NO PICK UP IS INITIATED BY NINJAVAN",1,13-Sep-21,2,SG,,Sep,2021,Negative

Bought my item on 5/9 and the parcel is in transit since then. Until now!! It says that the parcel is being delivered today 14/9 since 11am. But until 5pm i received nothing. Called customer service because it will be delivered at my office which will be close at 6pm. When my call got answered, i ask if i can have the driver’s number so i could get in touch on his whereabouts. But the cust service person said that they dont have their drivers number and only contact thru system??? Who the f dont have infos about their drivers?? How do you do your work?? Not enough with that, im even baffled when i asked the cs person to checked my parcel location, and she said that the parcel has been delivered??!!! NinjaVan, I can confirm that I have not received any parcel nor received a visit from your fkn driver. And when i asked whats the solution. The only thing she can do is offer to write a report and will only get back in 3 days. now u asked me to wait again??! Ridiculous courier. Please dont ever use. Just throw eggs at their van",1,14-Sep-20,1,MY,,Sep,2020,Negative

Globe Telecom,1.1,Bad,Absolutely terrible service,"Absolutely terrible service. I live only one block from Davao City Hall. Our internet has been down for 10 days now. When we first called they said they were just upgrading the system and everything would be okay. After 3 days, we called to get someone from Globe to check our service. 2 days later someone came and they told us something was wrong - BUT NOTHING WAS FIXED BY THEM. They said they would come back. They called but did not schedule to return. They are now saying we should upgrade our service. We have 100 MBPS and it is more than we need - we just need it to work. This has been a terrible ordeal and has affected our work since we are working from home during Covid. It has also affected the kids school work. Globe - You need better service, and better people. You need to respond and actually make sure concerns are addressed in a timely manner. Very incompetent and absolutely no compassion for your customers. especially in this time of Covid. I have had Glove mobile and I can say the service is just as bad. I am glad your days of being one of the few players providing this service is numbered. Globe needs competition to step up to the plate and serve Filipinos better. As it is we overpay for your mediocre/substandard service. You should, at the very least, give people what they pay for and respond to fix issues as they arise.UPDATE: After numerous efforts to get this fixed, we found the most idiotic solution to the problem. I applied for globe residencial service of only 35 MBPS which worked instantly when connected and cancelled the above 100 MBPS service they could not and would not fix. Right now we are paying less and for the last two weeks it is working. No kudos/thanks to Globe since they never fixed the original issue. Also, don't ever try using the Facebook chat of Globe, one of the worst AIs/chat bots I've ever encountered. It won't solve anything for you.

In fact, it opened up another opportunity for another income stream, it is just a matter of putting it into action all the learnings we've gathered and eventually earn from trading by our own. In addition, the 3 coaching sessions which is included in the package with the great LTT coaches will really help us a lot in this journey of trading.  To conclude, the LTT Phils. family will not allow their students like me leaving the training with an empty handed, coaches sees to it that all their knowledge and skills in trading are imparted to us in their best way possible before they will leave us into the wild and start trading by our own.

Shopee,1.8,Poor,Fire Half of Your Customer Service Reps and Improve Your Review System,"Got an item that doesn't work. Tried to return using Shopee's return system, and the system cannot provide a shipper for me to use to return said item. Had to use the chat system with their CSRs. Out of 4 chats, I had two pleasant ones. The other two were aggravating experiences. One customer aggravation rep (CAR) kept told me to ship the item without a bar code printed, and then told me to fix my smartphone, even though I told her I had the same problem even when I was using a web browser on my laptop. And then told me I can't login to two devices at a time, which isn't true. She got frustrated and dropped the chat. The other CAR was so smug she ended the chat when I commented that I wish this wouldn't be another aggravating experience. Glad the last CSR was very helpful and allowed me to air my frustration with the CARs and managed to escalate my problem to a team. Shopee's system stands to improve a lot. I already mentioned its system cannot get me to return an item in-app, which would be convenient and which they wanted to do but couldn't manage to. So I ended up having to use another shipper with an app to print a bar code for shipping. But I would find out that some shipping apps cannot accept the return address of Shopee: it has the longest address in the world:Shopee WarehouseBlock 2, Lots 2,3,10 & 11, Honest St. co. Determined St., Calamba Premiere International Park (CPIP), Batino, Calamba City, South Luzon, Laguna Philippines 4027It all came down to Shopee telling me ship via J&T, and by then there's only one day left before the return window expires. Asked to extend it, they refused because they can't be bothered to make an exception, because of ""policy.""Terrible. Terrible customer service reps - very rude. And very unaccommodating system design - where it makes it very hard to make very very simple returns.The bad thing also is that I cannot make a review of the lousy product- A Youngrow wrist blood pressure monitor. Since I returned a lousy item, and that kept me from giving a terrible scathing review of the item in question. It needs to be said - Shopee's system of review is downright useless. You can't really make a review on a product. You can make a review on packaging, shipping speed and responsiveness to queries. But really, you are buying a product and you can't have a long term, much less medium term - update on your experience using a product. This makes it hard for sellers to offer products that have good quality but cost a premium. So you end up with sellers selling el cheapo products because the review system encourages them to do so. In effect, Shopee (as well as Lazada) sell cheap products that in the long run cost more to the consumer. Shopee can emulate Amazon, which has a great review system, but it chooses not to. It says a lot about where they stand on product quality and offering such products to the consumer.And Shopee isn't very customer-centric. It doesn't allow the consumer to save a transcript of chat sessions wth its CSRs. It does this by design. Because it knows half of its CSRs are rude, and it is afraid it's not going away because they do not vet their CSRs well enough. And there's no excuse for it. Philippines provide CSRs to the world, and with large companies such as Amazon, the CSRs have been very courteous all the time. Never a bad experience. So why is it that half of the CSRs of Shopee are rude and mislead clients with inane and wrong answers?",3,31-Jan-21,3,PH,,Jan,2021,Neutral

We’ve had numerous problems with our internet connection fluctuating from 30 Mbps to a constant 3-5 Mbps. They said it’s a problem with the line of our building but have never bothered to fix it. It’s been almost 6 months since the issue surfaced, and it hasn’t been put into an end. Not to mention, the days (even weeks) we have to wait for such an issue to be addressed.I would definitely not recommend PLDT for those people looking for a good internet service provider.

PLDT,1.1,Bad,The worst ISP in the Philippines,"The worst ISP in the Philippines! I have called, sent emails, used their imbecile FB bot and even exchanges comments on one of their FB posts, but none of these works! I first signed up for their 25mbps DSL plan. After a year on that plan, I upgraded it to 50mbps, but still did not work for us. So when their  fibr finally arrived in 2019, I was contacted and offered to do the upgrade of our existing 2-year plan to their Fibr Home. Hoping I can finally enjoy their service, I shifted to their 100mpbs plan without them telling me that it was for an extended 3-year plan. I was under the impression that it'll only be for 24mos plan. But I was only given a week to experience 60mbps+ speed. After that, my speed went back to the 1 to less than 10 mpbs. Seriously, PLDT? It looks like they only asked us to extend our subscription without giving us what we are paying and entitled for. There was even this instance wherein they sent their technician on the field, they checked our connection. And while they were ""accordingly"" at the site where the PLDT cabinet is situated near our place. The technician was kind enough to tell me the reason why I wasn't getting the subscribed speed. Because according to him, our line was not connected or plugged in to the 100mbps circuit inside their cabinet. I don't know if that's true, but I think, they really are rampantly doing that in order for them to attract new customers. And so he put me back to that circuit and we experienced up to 98mbps for 5 days (According to Ookla). But after 5 days, our speed returned back to the 1-10mbps and sometimes 0.30mbp speed that we are normally getting from them. Aside from the low speed, it can  be observed that no day in a week that this ISP won't give you headaches because of their every now and then network lags. I also don't know if this matters as well, when they upgraded our plan, the technician only changed our router. The old copper wire weren't replaced with the fiber optic cables usually used for fibr connections. When I asked about it, I was told by their dispatched technicians that the old DSL line (copper wire) should be sufficient enough to handle the new speed. For those of you who have the knowledge about this process. Is it true that the old copper wire connected from our house to the cabinet should be sufficient to improve our upgraded plan from 25mbps to 100mbps, from DSL to fibr? Will that not really affect the speed and our connection? Coz I read that the main reason they are upgrading it from DSL to fibr, and that the speed improves a lot on fibr connection, was because of the fiber optic cables that they are using, the information (data) can travel fast using fibr optic cables, compared to the congested copper wires used in DSL connections. If they won't change our cables (copper line), I think we really won't get a good speed and the rampant connection lags wont stop. The technician left us after installing the new router and after simply saying that they do not need to change our copper line, without really attending to our concerns. According to them our old DSL (copper line), should still work well for us. I'll appreciate if a tech savvy and well experienced one, can help us answer this, so we can insist with them to replace it, coz probably that's the problem here. But nevertheless, unless PLDT change the way this company and its people does their work, they deserve nothing, but negative scores and negative reviews. And I think we should all launch one collective complaint against PLDT to the proper government offices like NTC, so we can be heard and have this rotten company be accountable to Filipino people, especially to their subscribers. I heard they launched another product called Beyond Fiber for work at Home people and for small businesses, I am hoping to hear from those who switched to this new plan and see if they already experienced improved connections.The worst part is, they are already aware of the problem, but they are not doing any action to fix it. Now, if they can't fix and if they cannot provide service. They do not have the right to ask for payment for the service they did not render. But the problem is, I think the other reviewer is right, this Company is a thief, a robber! They only want their customers money . They cannot even issue credits for the number of months that we did not use their rotten service. And I think our dear politicians who are acting like Pinoy superheroes should look into this illegal and unacceptable ways of PLDT doing their business, they must be investigated and be castigated too This company is getting richer and richer everyday out of forcibly collecting payments from their subscribers who are pissed off of their rotten services!",1,Updated 11 Aug 2020,1,PH,Updated,Aug,2020,Negative

What an absolutely waste of my and the seller’s time. Ultimately, the things I wanted to order got out of stock due to incompetence of this company. When they decided to reschedule my parcel, I actually sent an email complaint about it. Got no response aside from their auto response email (which I expected). Then, the next day, they decided to RTS my order.  The nerve! All in all, will never rely on this courier ever again! I should have believed the enormous negative feedbacks for this company.

Lazada,1.5,Bad,I am very disappointed with Lazada.,I am very disappointed with Lazada. I have been an active customer for the last two years. This is the second time this has happened and there will not be a third time. I ordered an item three weeks ago. I received a confirmation email that I paid for it out of my wallet credit and the item was shipped. A couple days later I received shipment on the wrong product. When I contacted Lazada by live chat they told me to go on line to make the return. Four weeks later they still have not contacted me on my product I paid for which is still not delivered. I have since found that there are other more reliable online companies out here. Lazada has lost my business and many of my friends as well. I have shared my new online shopping find with them and will continue to do so.,1,28-Dec-18,1,PH,,Dec,2018,Negative

Worrying thing is today we got a scam email about a PAL booking we never made with part of the information being correct from our original tickets.

Avoid (this should be obvious) buying from SELLERs with low ratings (less than 80%). These are normally the problematic ones.

PLDT,1.1,Bad,PLDT : An Abomination of a Telco,"This company is one of the worst I have ever transacted with. They have agents who call you up at home and offer you products, one of which is this Tvolution Roku which their agent offered as a free trial last August 2017. Two weeks after I received the unit, I was ready to return it because I did not find any use for it since we already had smart TVs and an Apple TV. I was shocked to learn from their customer care hotline that our account had been considered a closed transaction and that we were locked in for 3 yrs paying P199 a month! To have it disconnected, we had to pay P3800+ for early termination. This was totally unauthorized and I regret ever having given that agent a single minute of my time only to be deceived. I have filed a complaint letter early September 2017 and have repeatedly followed up, up to now December 2017, they have not terminated the service without prejudice and continue to insist that I authorized the transaction. Talk about customer satisfaction at its WORST! I find no other recourse but to file legal action against this abomination named PLDT. My only wish for this company is it’s eventual downfall and closure because they have dissatisfied thousands of customers with their arrogance and failure to deliver on their promises to provide good service to their customers. Suffice it to say that as soon as a new player comes in, majority of its customers will gladly abandon them which I will greatly applaud!",1,12-Dec-17,1,US,,Dec,2017,Negative

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,Stay the hell away from Flower Store PH,"Please stay away from Flower Store PH. Their customer service tricks you into believing that it is IMPOSSIBLE to cancel your order when their FAQ tells you otherwise. They also “forget” to give you your refund.“We're not allowing any changes with regards to the order details due to the high volume of orders hence it's not possible to modify orders that have already been prepared” After insisting that their own site has different policies and fighting that my order says it’s only created, NOT prepared, that’s when they send me an email saying that my order is cancelled. At least they asked for my PayPal details for the refund. Unfortunately the story does even end there. On the supposed day of delivery, a driver still called saying he was about to deliver my order. There was absolutely no coordination between their customer service and Cebu branch. After 11 days of waiting for the refund, I messaged them again but they said my refund request was overlooked by the refund team. Flowerstore.Ph “forgot” to add my name to their refund list.

Globe Telecom,1.1,Bad,VERY POOR AS USUAL,"We upgraded our intenet package to fibre at P1700 per month. Two days later it was installed and they connected a non cordless phone and said the phone would be activated soon. We are still waiting for the phone to be activated!!!The Internet has to be reset about 5 times if there's a brownout. Also we found out two days ago (2 months after the installation) that we had to pay a deposit. We were never told when we signed up initially. The bill stated the payment was due on 5 September. However, yesterday they cut off our intenet without any warning until we paid the deposit. Why cut us off if you state a payment date of 5 September??If we had been told about the deposit we would have paid it before we were cut off. Globe then had the cheek to email us stating dear valued customer.  Globe do not in any way value their customers and they don't seem or want to understand that customers pay staff salaries and shareholders dividends. Without customers Globe would not exist!!! Basically Globe do not care in any way at all, all they are interested in is getting your money and offer a very very poor service.Finally our old account with Globe has P807 in credit because I had overpaid. For some reason I had to write a letter to Globe to have the P807 transferred to our new account. The transfer should be automatic and not need a pointless letter.I would never recommend Globe to anyone not even my worst enemy.",1,Updated 27 Aug 2021,7,PH,Updated,Aug,2021,Negative

I am thankful to LTT because with my UW Gold membership, I can just re-sit If I need to in the same trainings. It is also worth the mention and commendation is the importance of Smartcharts in a trader's work. The AI in Smartchart with its strategies is a great help most specially to newbies just like me.

Waited all the way until 9.55pm to update tracking status, indicating failed delivery  - most likely because couriers weren’t able to finish their deliveries before 10pm. Classic example of promising beyond what they can deliver. Now they tell me it will be here before 10pm tomorrow, but am I supposed to cancel my plans yet again for a no show? The worst part would be the unresponsiveness of email enquiries - had tried sending emails to ask about the delivery statuses of my previous orders but the replies always come back ages later when item has already been thrown outside door without warning.",1,15-Nov-20,1,SG,,Nov,2020,Negative

These mandates are beyond my control.  Then upon my return to Guam, I will have to go through another 14-day quarantine.   I had no choice but to cancel my trip.  I went to see the travel agent, Goodwind Travel, for a refund.  I was told the Philippines Airlines doesn't give a refund for promo ticket purchases.

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,WORST COURIER SERVICE IN SG,"Ninjavan is arguable one of THE WORST courier services I have used in Singapore. Please. Use DHL, JnT, SingPost, just any other courier service other than Ninjavan if you want to receive your parcel safely. Not only is Ninjavan’s delivery procedure ridiculously appalling, they DO NOT GIVE A CRAP ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. Normally, I would not pursue these kinds of matters, I have never bothered to write a review because of a bad experience for any type of service. I would just let it go. But their service is extremely appalling that I even created an account just to write a review because of how infuriated I am. I ordered a bottle of toner that cost $40 on shoppee, and the seller used Ninjavan to send it to me. This happened on Sunday 7/11/20, I was at home the entire day, busy with work. Around 9pm I opened the shoppee application and I realised it said delivery complete. Because there were no knocks on the door, neither was there any sms/call notifications, I assumed the item was sent to the letter box because it was a small bottle of toner. I checked my letter box and I realised I hadn’t received the item and contacted the seller. The seller then sent me an image from ninjavan’s delivery man that the item was already delivered. Prior to this parcel, I had used ninjavan before and I opted for contactless delivery since the items I ordered was small, and as stated by ninjavan, if a customer opts for contactless delivery, delivery verification code is not needed for drivers to drop the parcel at the location provided that it is a SAFE HIDDEN LOCATION. Tell me. Does this look safe nor hidden? As a result of the delivery man leaving it here (I stay on the second floor beside the stairwell where there are many people coming and going all the time), the parcel was stolen. Following this, I talked to Suriya on Ninjavan’s live chat on telegram, and she didn’t help me at all, after explaining to her the problem she simply asked me to email ninjavan and when I requested for help, she left the chat! I was shocked. After which, I emailed ninjavan’s customer service and talked to many other reps, such as Hana, Intan, Adira, whereby these representatives tried to avoid responsibility and even apologised for this “unintentional and rare mistake”. So ninjavan is aware of their mistake in handling the delivery procedure, yet they refuse to refund me and even tries (on multiple attempts) to ask me to ask the seller for a refund. For what? The seller was responsible, sent the goods on time, and even tried to help me with the refund process from ninjavan. Perhaps the only wrong thing the seller ever did was to use ninjavan as her courier service of choice. I even called the customer service number and the lady on the phone asked me to email them to “try my luck” for a refund. IS THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE? I was extremely understanding and nice to all customer service representatives I had talked to. But all of ninjavan’s customer service reps just tried to push the problem to the seller, and asked me to ask her for a refund instead. I refused because this is simply not the seller’s fault? The fault lies within ninjavan’s delivery procedure? Even if I opted for contactless delivery, would it be that hard to knock on the door so I know he had left it outside and I can bring it in? Is it so difficult to place the small bottle of toner in a safe and hidden location such as in between my gate and door? What infuriates me the most is ninjavan’s irresponsibility as a courier service? Ninjavan’s service disgusts me. This is the worst customer service I have ever received in my entire life. They admit they are in the wrong, but they do not refund me for the lost goods, and they try to push the blame to the seller? This is outrageous. Never again will I use Ninjavan as my courier of choice. This was a small mistake because of the deliveryman that caused me to lose a meagre $40, if they had simply apologised right away, not trying to push the blame to me, by saying I am the one who opted for contactless delivery, or to the seller, asking me to ask her for a refund instead when it is clearly not her fault, I would not be as enraged. DISGUSTING SERVICE. And please, please don't reply to this review trying to do service recovery telling me how my feedback is valuable and apologise that I did not have a good experience and to further contact ninjavan so you can better my experience. Because from what I have experience with your service and your many customer service representatives I have spoken to, every single one gave me complete utter nonsense. If it was possible I would give 0 stars.",1,10-Nov-20,1,SG,,Nov,2020,Negative

The Facebook page of this online flower shop was filled with complaints on V-day which was gone the next day. The shop posted an apology to the customers who did not receive the bouquets because of a flower supply problem. So, was I lucky? Nope. My partner paid a lot.

LBC Express,1.2,Bad,Horrible!,"The excitement you feel will die down bcs of this incompetent courier. If someone would have told me a week ago that I'll be writing smth bad abt LBC, I would've laughed and think, ""it's impossible"" but here I am: UNSATISFIED. UNHAPPY. Most importantly, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COURIER ANYMORE. Had the chance to use JRS but I didn't bcs I have too much faith on this courier since my first transaction. Now, it's gone like a bubble.",1,23-Sep-20,1,PH,,Sep,2020,Negative

Lazada,1.5,Bad,I purchased a Dell Laptop for my wife…,"I purchased a Dell Laptop for my wife in late June 2018 by October it started making noises when she charged it and got hot and began to turn the case white. When we attempted to contact the seller Laptopkid they gave us the run around and eventually stopped responding to my texts. I contact Lazada and they are worse, they say they will refer us to a repair facility and they will evaluate if we will be charged! Yeah right, not a chance of going through that. What a scam and they try to represent themselves as a legitimate company. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM.",1,19-Jan-19,2,US,,Jan,2019,Negative

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,Philippine Airlines - First Class Airline,"I haven't flown Philippine Airlines for many years simply because they stopped flying from London to Manila. Even though they started flying direct from Heathrow to Manila a couple of years ago, my wife and I continued to fly on alternative airlines. When planning our trip for March back in January this year, I managed to secure a great flight price with Philippine Airlines and decided to try them once again. Wow, what a great decision I made. The plane was spacious and comfortable (our economy seats had great legroom), the choice of meals was excellent and the food was delicious, the cabin crew were extremely attentive and customer service was their priority. Nothing was too much trouble. They were all amazing on both the outbound and inbound flights. I will definitely fly with them again in the future. Thank you so much Philippine Airlines.",5,7-Apr-18,1,GB,,Apr,2018,Positive
